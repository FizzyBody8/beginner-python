## Variables
### Assign
  You can assign a variable by setting it using the = sign.
  `pizza = happiness + 1`
### Use
  You can use the variable by calling it.
  `pizza + bad day == great day`
  "==" is not equivalent to "=","==" means that it is the same, not setting a variable.
###Types
  Boolean are true or false statements, strings are like words or sentences, and integers are numbers.
  ```
  "Boolean" == True or False
  "String" == "What is todays date?"
  "Integers" == 1
  ```
## Conditions
###Expressions
  Are statements like if, else, elif, and, or, etc.
  ```
  if 5 > x and x > 3
    print "x = 4"

  ```
###Branching
  Branching is the structure of your code and allows you to create complex "logic gates".
  ```
  if x > 4
    print "Yes"
  else:
    print "No"
  x = 5
  ```
## Functions
  Functions are a block of code that is used to preform a single related action.
  ```
  def hello (what):
    text = "Hello, " + what + "!"
    print text

  hello ("World")

  #Prints Hello, world!
  ```
